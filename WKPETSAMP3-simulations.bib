	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

                Geostatistical data—spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon— are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.
              
              
                Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package’s use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.
              
              
                
                  We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of
                  glm()
                  , lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).
                
              
              
                We hope that sdmTMB’s user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

	abstract = {Bycatch, the non-intentional capture or killing of non-target species in commercial or recreational ﬁsheries, is a world wide threat to protected, endangered or threatened species (PETS) of marine megafauna. Obtaining accurate bycatch estimates of PETS is challenging: the only data available may come from non-dedicated schemes, and may not be representative of the whole ﬁsheries effort. We investigated, with simulated data, a model-based approach for estimating PETS bycatch from non-representative samples. We leveraged recent development in the statistical analysis of surveys, namely regularized multilevel regression with post-stratiﬁcation, to infer total bycatch under realistic scenarios of data sampling such as under-sampling or over-sampling when PETS bycatch risk is high. Post-stratiﬁcation is a survey technique to re-align the sample with the population and addresses the problem of non-representative samples. Post-stratiﬁcation requires to sub-divide a population of interest into potentially hundreds of cells corresponding to the cross-classiﬁcation of important attributes. Multilevel regression accommodate this data structure, and the statistical technique of regularization can be used to predict for each of these hundreds of cells. We illustrated these statistical ideas by modeling bycatch risk for each week within a year with as few as a handful of observed PETS bycatch events. The model-based approach led to improvements, under mild assumptions, both in terms of accuracy and precision of estimates and was more robust to non-representative samples compared to more design-based methods currently in use. In our simulations, there was no detrimental effects of using the model-based even when sampling was representative. Estimating PETS bycatch ideally requires dedicated observer schemes and adequate coverage of ﬁsheries effort. We showed how a model-based approach combining sparse data typical of PETS bycatch and recent methodological developments can help when both dedicated observer schemes and adequate coverage are challenging to implement.},

	abstract = {IntroductionSeabirds are abundant, conspicuous members of marine ecosystems worldwide. Synthesis of distribution data compiled over time is required to address regional management issues and understand ecosystem change. Major challenges when estimating seabird densities at sea arise from variability in dispersion of the birds, sampling effort over time and space, and differences in bird detection rates associated with survey vessel type.MethodsUsing a novel approach for modeling seabirds at sea, we applied joint dynamic species distribution models (JDSDM) with a vector-autoregressive spatiotemporal framework to survey data collected over nearly five decades and archived in the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database. We produced monthly gridded density predictions and abundance estimates for 8 species groups (77\% of all birds observed) within Cook Inlet, Alaska. JDSDMs included habitat covariates to inform density predictions in unsampled areas and accounted for changes in observed densities due to differing survey methods and decadal-scale variation in ocean conditions. ResultsThe best fit model provided a high level of explanatory power (86\% of deviance explained). Abundance estimates were reasonably precise, and consistent with limited historical studies. Modeled densities identified seasonal variability in abundance with peak numbers of all species groups in July or August. Seabirds were largely absent from the study region in either fall (e.g., murrelets) or spring (e.g., puffins) months, or both periods (shearwaters).DiscussionOur results indicated that pelagic shearwaters (Ardenna spp.) and tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) have declined over the past four decades and these taxa warrant further investigation into underlying mechanisms explaining these trends. JDSDMs provide a useful tool to estimate seabird distribution and seasonal trends that will facilitate risk assessments and planning in areas affected by human activities such as oil and gas development, shipping, and offshore wind and renewable energy.},

	abstract = {The Working Group on Bycatch of Protected Species (WGBYC) was established in 2007 and col-lates and analyses information from across the Northeast Atlantic and adjacent sea areas (Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas) related to the bycatch in commercial fishing operations of pro-tected and sensitive species including marine mammals, seabirds, turtles and sensitive fish spe-cies. WGBYC seeks to describe and improve understanding of the likely impacts of fishing activities on affected populations, to inform on the suitability of existing at-sea monitoring programmes for assessing sensitive species bycatch, and to collate information on bycatch mitigation efforts. In 2022, the WG hybrid meeting addressed seven Terms of Reference (ToR). The report provides an overview of data collection activities during 2021 including details of reported monitoring and fishing effort data, and bycatch records that were submitted to the WGBYC database in 2022 following a formal data call. Data were requested from 17 of the 20 ICES countries, six EU Mediterranean countries and two EU Black Sea countries. 24 of the 25 contacted countries submitted data. WGBYC developed a new approach for evaluating and assessing bycatch across the full range of relevant taxa by considering a range of criteria, including data quality, within group expertise and the existence of management/conservation objectives. Preliminary results based on a selec-tion of 35 Ecoregion/species/métier level 4 combinations indicated that just 9 had low monitoring bias, and also highlighted that clear conservation objectives are generally lacking for most spe-cies and areas. This approach will be further developed by WGBYC to underpin the requirements of the agreement between ICES and DGMARE for the provision of annual advice on bycatch. WGBYC provided qualitative information for several species/populations of marine mammals, seabirds, turtles and fish, that are currently considered to be at significant risk due to fisheries bycatch, but because of their rarity are not well represented in existing fisheries monitoring da-tasets. A risk-based approach to highlight monitoring gaps and inform coordinated sampling designs was further developed and provided useful insights into which métiers may be under-sampled by existing at-sea data collection programmes with respect to sensitive species bycatch. WGBYC prepared tables and plots describing data reporting in 2021, multi-annual bycatch rates and trends in fishing effort, to contribute to the 2022 recurrent and fisheries overviews advice drafting process. {\textless}br{\textgreater}},

Although quantitative estimates of albatross bycatch are often unavailable due to a relative or total absence of monitoring, spatial overlap between fisheries and albatrosses is often used to estimate the extent of interaction, a proxy for exposure to bycatch, and to inform avoidance and mitigation actions. Using comprehensive records of commercial demersal longline and trap fishing and survey information for albatrosses (black-footed albatross

              ), the extent of spatial potential interaction was estimated in Canada’s Pacific coast waters and examined across breeding and non-breeding seasons. The distributions of albatrosses and longline and trap fisheries were found to substantially overlap, with potential interaction hotspots concentrated along the continental shelf break. Trap fisheries reported 1 albatross bycatch incident, suggesting that these fisheries are responsible for negligible albatross mortalities. In contrast, {\textgreater}80\% of recorded albatross bycatch incidents occurred within 10 km of albatross-longline fisheries hotspot locations, providing evidence that longline-albatross potential interaction hotspots represent actual areas of elevated bycatch mortality risk. Indicative of potential conservation concern, 60\% of short-tailed albatross sightings occurred within 10 km, and 93\% within 30 km, of longline-albatross potential interaction hotspots. By contributing knowledge regarding albatross-fisheries interactions, in addition to undertaking the first evaluation of albatross-fisheries hotspots with recorded bycatch incidents on Canada’s Pacific coast, this study represents a step towards enhancing albatross conservation through bycatch avoidance and mitigation.},

	abstract = {Bycatch in fisheries is a major threat to many seabird species. Understanding and predicting spatiotemporal changes in seabird bycatch from fisheries might be the key to mitigation. Inter-annual spatiotemporal patterns are evident in seabird bycatch of the U.S. Atlantic pelagic longline fishery monitored by the National Marine Fisheries Service Pelagic Observer Program (POP) since 1992. A newly developed fast computing Bayesian approximation method provided the opportunity to use POP data to understand spatiotemporal patterns, including temporal changes in location of seabird bycatch hotspots. A Bayesian model was developed to capture the inherent spatiotemporal structure in seabird bycatch and reduce the bias caused by physical barriers such as coastlines. The model was applied to the logbook data to estimate seabird bycatch for each longline set, and the mid-Atlantic bight and northeast coast were the fishing areas with the highest fleet bycatch estimate. Inter-annual changes in predicted bycatch hotspots were correlated with Gulf Stream meanders, suggesting that predictable patterns in Gulf Stream meanders could enable advanced planning of fishing fleet schedules and areas of operation. The greater the Gulf Stream North Wall index, the more northerly the seabird bycatch hotspot two years later. A simulation study suggested that switching fishing fleets from the hindcasted actual bycatch hotspot to neighboring areas and/or different periods could be an efficient strategy to decrease seabird bycatch while largely maintaining fishers’ benefit.},
