## Parametrization for a seabird example

The current example is based on data from the Reference fleet in Norway (IMR). More information on The Norwegian Reference fleet can be found [here](https://www.hi.no/en/hi/cruises-and-field-work/the-reference-fleet). In this particular case we consider bycatch of Northern fulmars in a sample of the high sea long line fishery where we have high confidence in that the reported numbers are close to actual numbers of bycatch. It is still worth keeping in mind, however, that the observed probabilities of bycatch events and n bycatch per event have to be considered biased by the sampling done (e.g., already including an observation error that might might shape those parameters).

First we start by sourcing all needed functions from the github repository  
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlusseau/scoti/main/estimate_fishing_effort_metier.R")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlusseau/scoti/main/heterogeneity_stats_distributions.r")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlusseau/scoti/main/make_fishing_year_metier.r")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlusseau/scoti/main/monitor_BPUE_metier.R")
```


First, we use a function to parameterize the fishery. The first parameter (nboat) is the size of the active fishing fleet, which in this case study is 28 longliner vessels. The next parameter controls the mean number of fishing events per boat day. In this case study vessel is the primary sampling unit, and we assume that one day at sea equals one haul (i.e., mean fishing event per boat day is one). The data represent one metier (L4, LLF_DES_0_0_0), so the probability of recording at one metier is set to one. 

The next couple of parameters concerns the probability of a bycatch event: The mean number of birds taken given an event, as well as the potential of more extreme events (probability of a large bycatch event as well as the mean number of individuals taken in those events). In the case study , a rough estimate of the probability of a bycatch event (bycatch events/fishing operations) is XX, and mean number of fullmars taken as bycatch in a bycatch event is XX. The probability of a large Within the function  Parameters are modeled as gamma/hurdle models, with out considering the nested structure of vessel. 
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}

# Simulate the true state of the fishery
nboat <- 28
mean.fishing.event.boat.day <- 1
p.metier <- 1
p.bycatch <- 0.12 # range is from 0.02 to 0.12
p.large.event <- 0.007
mean.bycatch.event <- 2 # (rounded down from 2.4)
mean.bycatch.large.event <- 36 # max in dataset is 36 
stochastic <- FALSE
BPUE_real = sum(fishing$nbycatch) / dim(fishing)[1]

```

Secondly we define the monitoring 
We don't have any actual data to calculate detection probability of individual birds in the catch, but we use a fixed probability [0.7](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220797) found for similar fisheries in the literature. We thus assume that some  we dont have any information that this is likely to vary in time or space. Rejection of participating    

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=TRUE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}

```

We have a fishing year that make sense for the fishery, trying to run a full simulation
